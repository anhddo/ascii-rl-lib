Steps to run the code
- create python environment and install gymnasium package
- activate the environment
- `dune exec src/bin/main.exe` to run the code


Implement multiple RL algorithm (5-6)
- each can solve all of the simulation
- bc the games are relatively simple

Then we also create a few simulations ourselves
- need the physics/logic of a working simulation
- take input from any of the RL algorithms
- and also respond and give feedback to the algorithm

Glue Code for running an algorithm with a particular simulation, possibly with a graphical interface (either ascii or normal)
- ascii or normal depends on how well it will work
- work through the step by step action and response
