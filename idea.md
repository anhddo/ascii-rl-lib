### Idea

We plan to implement a Reinforcement Learning (RL) library and apply various RL algorithms to a control simulation environment (https://gymnasium.farama.org). The library will allow users to train RL models, save/load models, and will support algorithms such as Q-learning, Policy Gradient, and Actor-Critic, and others.

### Libraries

Since the simulation is written in Python, we will use the PyML library to interface with the simulation. We plan for our library to only use Core, and we will develop the listed algorithms from scratch.
